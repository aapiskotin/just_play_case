## Important Notes

The assumptions made during the research are base on the provided data and my
humble experience of solving the problems of similar nature. Given the specifics of
every business and the audiences the business serves, the assumptions and solutions
might not be directly applicable to the JustPlay case. However, my purpose here
is to solve the problems as it was presented in the transparent way, so that the
framework of solving ML problems could be understood and applied to the real-world 
cases.
